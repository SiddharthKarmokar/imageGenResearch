### **9. Midjourney**

* State of the Art Image generation( benchmarked as best )
* Access via ui or discord( we can create api link / already available )
* The only time when video generation is worth considering, examples on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/midjourney/)
* I used the already existing images from reddit, as no free tier is available
* 10$/month billed monthly or 8$/month billed anually( basic plan )
* Standard( 30$/month or 24$/month ), Pro and Mega plans come with "relax" gpu mode, which lets us create as many images as we want however they will take longer to create
